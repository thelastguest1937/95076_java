dont try this at home, or at all.
how to download minecraft. (Instructions might not work, idk.
is click the green code button on this repository screen and click "download zip" while its on "HTTPS". dont put it on the key thing or github client. after you downloaded the zip, try to find the folder in your devices files and then go searching through that folder and double click on "offline_download_Version.Html" to start minecraft. enjoy!
